## 2024-05-14 - XXE Vulnerability in EVTX Log Parsing
**Vulnerability:** External XML Entity (XXE) injection was possible because `lxml.etree.fromstring` was used to parse EVTX logs without explicitly disabling external entity resolution.
**Learning:** The default `etree.fromstring` behavior in lxml resolves external entities. Also, `lxml.etree.fromstring` can throw exceptions with strings containing an XML declaration, requiring conversion to utf-8 bytes first.
**Prevention:** Always initialize `etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)` when parsing untrusted XML, and ensure the input is encoded to utf-8 bytes (`xml_string.encode('utf-8') if isinstance(xml_string, str) else xml_string`) before passing to `etree.fromstring`.

## 2026-03-31 - SSRF via XML DTD Fetching
**Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Denial of Service (DoS) risks were present because `lxml.etree.XMLParser` allowed network access to fetch external DTDs.
**Learning:** While `resolve_entities=False` prevents traditional XXE, the parser can still make network requests to retrieve external Document Type Definitions (DTDs) if `no_network=True` is not explicitly set.
**Prevention:** Always initialize `etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False, no_network=True)` when parsing untrusted XML to completely isolate the parser from external network interactions.
## 2024-05-15 - CSV/Formula Injection in Results Export
**Vulnerability:** Results from inference contained LLM outputs that were written directly to CSV using pandas `to_csv`. Untrusted inputs beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` could lead to CSV Formula Injection when the file is opened in spreadsheet software like Excel.
**Learning:** Always sanitize user or LLM-generated strings exported to CSV, as the downstream consumers might be spreadsheet applications vulnerable to formula execution.
**Prevention:** Sanitize both `object` and `string` pandas columns by prepending a single quote `'` to any value starting with the formula-triggering characters before exporting via `to_csv`.
